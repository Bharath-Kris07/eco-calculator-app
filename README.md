## üöÄ About The Project

This project reinvents the simple calculator by adding new features and API integrations. Instead of just numbers, you can calculate the carbon footprint (CO2e) of:
* **Travel:** Based on distance and vehicle type.
* **Energy:** Based on electricity usage.

The app is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use. It features a robust fallback system, using local data if the live API call fails, ensuring a reliable user experience.
